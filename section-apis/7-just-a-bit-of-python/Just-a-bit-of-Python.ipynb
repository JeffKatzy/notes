That is, we have learned how the browser makes requests to receive information back from another computer connected to the Internet.  We learned about how we request information with a `GET` request from a URL generally organized into `resources`.  We saw that we receive back a response, in the form of HTML for normal browsing of the Internet, and in the form of JSON when only would like to receive this data in a form that is easier for programming languages like Python to interact with."
