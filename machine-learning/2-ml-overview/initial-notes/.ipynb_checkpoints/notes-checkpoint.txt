### Expressing features and target variables with math

Now there's one more thing to point out that we may generally express our feature inputs with the variable $x$ and our target data with the variable $y$.

| angle        | actual distance           
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|    .30        | 8 feet | 
|    .50        | 11 feet |

So with the data angle = .30 and distance = .80, we could say that the $x = .30$ and $y = .80$ for that observation.

If we want to distinguish values for our first and second observations we use a superscript like so:

$x^{(1)} = .30, y^{(1)} = 8$

$x^{(2)} = .50, y^{(2)} = 11$



Move info about the data above, or perhaps even into a separate lesson.
Add in the pictures and charts about how this works.
