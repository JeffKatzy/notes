Maybe it's because I'm part vampire or due to my depression, but I really like hanging out in the dark, so the dim lighting suited me and since this is Downtown Dallas, you can expect to find colorful patrons (people from all walks of life) at this establishment. I had a 7:30 pm reservation on a Friday night via Open Table (I love anything that screams loyalty program and points for free stuff) and the party must've not gotten started till later because it was a very calm atmosphere. The only nag I had as far as atmosphere goes was that the music choice was not for me. Wine + Chicken does not equal Mr. Brightside by The Killers. As much as I love that song and as much as I like the fact that it's a casual scene, I expected more of a classy vibe. \u00a0Can we get some Maxwell, some Santana, BTS's House of Cards, or Erykah Badu? If you need a Resturant Musical Selectionist, have your people call my people. Kus right now...you got no jams (BTS REFERENCE). Also, dirty silverware was not a good look. On to the food...The sliders were ok, I should've followed my mind and opted out of the honey butter it was way too sweet and drowned out the nice taste of the chicken.Also, only 2/3 of my sliders were correctly made. Did you guys run out of lettuce back there? This was how it was originally set on the table; open-faced, by the way. And the waiter/ server said nothing about it either...I could've been bad and bougie but plates returned to the kitchen have a tendency to provoke a little \"tasty\" revenge from irate chefs/servers alike. I stole a tender from a family members plate for a \"correct\" taste and the chicken is actually not that bad! Its full of taste but can come off a little bit salty and dry. But lots of taste is better that none at all. It has a similar taste to Street's Fine Chicken. I should've just stuck to my tried and true \"meat n bread\".I also decided to try another popular menu item: the Max 'N Cheese. \u00a0I don't know why the mac and cheese is so raved about because it was so bland... May I suggest adding some Velveeta brand's, Queso Blanco??The french fries were a surprise big hit though, I really liked them! Salt and pepper need to be on these tables to add a little more taste.

My wife and I went to a show last Thursday night, and knew we would be eating late and booked a table through Google/Open Table for 10:30pm. Having worked in a restaurant for 6 years in the past, I know that nobody gets excited for the last table of the night to show up 30 mins before close (when the kitchen is supposed to close when we arrive) and I have empathy for the crew when we are the last table. Fortunately, the bar manager Sean and the executive chef Sam made us feel like we were the complete opposite of a bother. They were incredible to us. My wife has Celiac Disease. We had a question for Sean about if one item could be made gluten free. Rather than guess, he brought Sam out from the kitchen and Sam explained everything and answered all of my wife's questions, including explaining why some things could not be modified to be gluten free. Sean's attentiveness, kindness, and attention to detail really showed throughout the dinner. He even remembered something we said shortly after we arrived, and acknowledged it as we were leaving. Very thoughtful. The food was spot on. Everything came out perfect and Sean checked on us as well as Sam came out to ask us how everything was. He even explained how the ribs were prepared and gave me a tip on how to make corn as good as that which came with the ribs. The warm brussel sprouts on the seasonal menu were the best we have ever had anywhere. They are a must, even if you don't think you like brussel sprouts.Not once did we feel rushed or that anyone was growing impatient with us. Sean and Sam were genuinely polite and friendly from the moment we sat down until we left and that meant a lot. I understand they are both relatively new, so I hope they become a critical part of the long term plan, because while the food was very good, their service will have us back the next time we go downtown."}, {"rating": 3.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "Probably didn't catch them on their best day"}, {"rating": 3.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "Food was pretty good, customer service sucked!

Unfortunately, brunch was better and dinner was not quite so successful.We started with the fried oysters ($11). To me, they had no taste, no flavor. I had piece of shell in one so I am glad I did not break a tooth. Both the wife and I found the insides to be chewy and not all that pleasant. Would not order again. I got the \"signature\" burger, which sounded great on the menu ($15). I usually get medium but I asked for it not to be too red in the middle and the waitress said I should get medium well. As it turned out, the burger was way past well and was completely dried out. I added bacon ($3) and asked for crispy but it was burned. There is a difference between crispy and burned. I also added blue cheese ($2) but even so the dryness could not be overcome. There are lots of great burgers in Dallas. This was not one of them. Would not order again. I ordered the Rahr Dadgum IPA which was good ($6) but when I asked for a second the waitress said they did not have only cold ones, they had just put some in the frig. Really? On a Saturday night you don't have cold beers?The wife got the shrimp and grits ($22) and liked the flavor, but the grits had huge clumps from not being stirred adequately. Overall, it was a disappointment. If I return it will be with a Groupon for brunch. On the positive side, the service was good and the background music (classic rock) was enjoyable although a bit loud for normal conversation, which suggests an identity crisis. \u00a0Is the restaurant supposed to be a party place for drinking or an upscale restaurant for dinner?"}, {"rating": 4.0, "date": "6/27/2017", "text": "Fried chicken that doesn't make you feel like a ball of oil afterwards? Max's has got your back. Don't get me wrong I love fried chicken of all forms - the crispier and more flavorful the skin the better. Sadly this usually means more oil and not the healthiest ingredients. At Max's you don't have to compromise flavor for your arteries! The fried chicken has a thin, crispy, not too oily skin that comes served with greens. The full order comes with 3 large pieces and is a feast. I enjoyed the Fried Chicken biscuit benedict with the nice runny egg and honey topped biscuit. They have Frank's Red hot sauce! Perfect for the chicken. Of the three mimosas we tried the prickly pear was my favorite for a truly unique flavor. Grapefruit was good and pomegranate was just a bit too sweet for me.

I was the first in my party to arrive, about 10 minutes early, and was seated immediately inside the restaurant. Water came quickly; in genera, the service here was quick and excellent.I had looked at the brunch menu beforehand, so I already knew that I wanted to try the honey butter benedict. Since Max's is known for their fried chicken, I wanted to pick something that gave me that experience, but I didn't want something too heavy like a full plate of fried chicken so early on a Saturday. I started out with the prickly pear mimosa, which had a great color and flavor. I also tried the pomegranate and grapefruit mimosas that others in my party got; they were also quite tasty!My cousin and I ended up splitting the benedict with a side of home fries, and it was the perfect amount of food for both of us. The portions were generous and the biscuits were flaky and light, unlike some places where it's super thick and hard to chew. Loved the jalapeno gravy and the runny yolk in the fried eggs, and the piece of fried chicken atop each biscuit was very well seasoned and didn't have too much breading. The chicken wasn't too tough or dry. Overall proportions of the benedict were really great; each bite was delicious. The home fries were a tad too salty, but our often-refilled waters helped with that. I also tried the cheesy jalapeno grits that my friend ordered, as well as a bite of the fried chicken, and both were excellent.I was a little disappointed that the groupon didn't cover alcoholic drinks; I'm not sure if that was in the fine print or not, but we didn't realize until after we got our check.

Another 10 minutes the waitress came to take our order, ironically it was the same waitress my husband and i had...oh goodness. It goes downhill from here, a couple of ladies two tables over from us got their food before us and they got there at least 10 minutes after we did. Then another young man came to our table and says, uh the tickets got messed up, what did y'all order? Either she didn't put the order in or completely lost it...why would he have to come back and ask us our order when she wrote it down. Same thing happened to the couple next to us...lost order. The waitress never came over to apologize just came once and said your food will be out shortly. Also, we never saw a manager either.

Went here for brunch over the weekend with my boyfriend and my goodness, this place does not let their customers down! This was my second time and his first. He was craving chicken and waffles and all I could think about was a good mimosa. I ordered the biscuits and gravy stack. Delicious is an understatement! The gravy was a perfect combination of creamy and spicy. I almost always need extra gravy but they provided a perfect amount for the biscuits. Think of a sausage-bacon biscuit sandwich. Again, SO GOOD!My boyfriend was very impressed with the chicken and waffles. The waffle is huge and the chicken batter is not too sweet but not too spicy and the presentation is bound to make anyone's mouth water. As for the mimosas, it's hard to go wrong! They offer customers to purchase an entire bottle of champagne and they supply the juice of your choice if you're wanting more to share. The individual mimosas are $3.75 each but they are generous with the size.

My sister was in town and we decided on a good glass of wine after a day of sight seeing. We had my 9 yr old niece with us so wanted to find a place where she would also be happy i.e. early desert! Online this place seemed to fit the bill but once we arrived we were let down. It is a pretty gloomy place. We arrived about 5:30pm and inquired about outside seating but were told no because she was the only one working and couldn't attend to tables outside. Now that's understandable but still weird to only have one employee running the whole restaurant. About ten minutes later another waiter showed up, I think his name was (Tyler? ) and she said it would be ok to sit outside now. Both the lady greeting us and our waiter were nice. I just think this restaurant really needs to put some more thought into the customer experience. Happy Hour is from 4PM-6PM. There were a couple of wines ranging from house wine starting at $5 to other varieties up to $10. We inquired about deserts and HH foods and our waiter was nice enough to cite them from memory but no menu?! We ended up going with 2 glasses of wine and fried pickles to share. My wine glass was dirty from lint or just not cleaned properly & the pickles were just not good. I did like the organic Pinot Grigio but would've not been happy if it was over the $6 HH price.

The restaurant is located in uptown, but there is a garage next to it where you can park. There's a decent patio sized area, which they cover for the winter and also comes equipped with outdoor heaters. The inside area has a classy feel to it with an open design. Between my girlfriend and I, we ordered the mac and cheese, bone marrow, pork belly, and max's chicken. The mac and cheese had good flavor, but I wish the sauce was a bit thicker and not so watery - 3/5.The pork belly was succulent and melt in your mouth good - 4/5.The bone marrow offered plenty of meat compared to other places but not so flavorful - but with the addition of the included toppings, it became more palatable - 3/5Max's fried chicken was the winner here - with crunchy skin and juicy meat. Not including korean fried chicken, I would say it's one of the best fried chicken I've ever had in this area. The meal includes 3 pieces (2 dark, 1 white), mashed potatoes, collard greens, texas toast, and a honey based dipping sauce. The mashed potatoes were delicious but the collard greens were just so-so. They offer a decent selection of wine but I ordered their house Old Fashioned. It was great but didn't come with an ice ball, even though it was $14. My girlfriend ordered a Riesling.

The restaurant is huge and there were plenty of open seating available. Our reservation was for 12:30pm. We were greeted warmly by the host and seated quickly. They have two tv's near the bar that was showing a current football game. My gf and I looked over the menu and thought the pricing for a few of the items were a bit high. Chicken wings and waffles were listed @ $18. They offer mimosas for about $4 a glass. The waiter suggested for us \u00a0to get a bottle of sparkling wine, (not champagne) if we were going to drink more than two glasses. The cheapest bottle was $26. We agreed and shortly after we had our bucket of champagne and two juices-orange and pomegranate arrive to our table.We both ordered the same entree Chicken wings and waffles. With the price of the entree, we had high expectations for the meal. How could you mess up chicken and waffles?? I didn't time when the dish was placed on our table, but I would guess it took about 10mins from the time we ordered to when it arrived. Surprised at how quickly it came out, babe and I dug in! The waffle was colder than the chicken, but neither one was piping hot. We both had 3 wings each which were seasoned well. Idk about you but I prefer my fried chicken piping hot. The waffle was good but not great. As we were sitting facing the kitchen, I noticed one of the cooks putting pieces of cooked fried chicken on a giant sheet pan and placing the pan on top of the oven. My guess is that the food is not made to order. They fry the chicken in batches and when an order is placed, they cook the waffle. I gave Max's 2 stars because the reservation process was easy, easy to find and get to. I wouldn't order the chicken wings and waffles again. I'm not sure if I would go back to be honest. I find it a tad bit odd and unsettling that the food came out so fast. If they are going to sell that entree that isn't made to order they should take a few dollars off.

Having ordered two eggs over hard, fruit and bacon, I didn't truly experience all that Max's has to offer (lots of guilt-inducing, delicious-sounding comfort foods). However, as far as the fried chicken goes - it was served at good temperature, a large/sizable piece and you could taste the hint of jalapeno in the batter (not spicy at all, but flavorful). My boyfriend's chicken came out looking a little different actually, and ended up tasting better than mine (the batter was thinner and his chicken was a bit more moist inside, mine was on the drier side). FYI - a la carte chicken is pretty pricey, so expect it to add up on the bill. Two other things that impressed me were the ambiance inside (just a cool place I'd like to hang out and grab a cocktail) and our server was really awesome (the kitchen cooked the a la carte chicken breast into my boyfriend's omelet, but the server was very apologetic and quick to fix it.

The appetizers were good enough to pay a visit during happy hour, but I'm not sure if I'll be back or not.

That woman is a delight and deserves a raise. Did you read that bosses? Everything she recommended was stellar and she made the evening that much more fun for us. She's truly the best. While they don't offer many drink specials at dinnertime, she mentioned that if you are willing to commit to two glasses then you can order from any of their bottles. I haven't heard of many places who let you do that, so we thought it was pretty cool.The food you guys? Dynamite. We had 5 people in our group so we ordered a little bit of everything. Here's the skinny:Drunk bread- It's bread soaked in wine then baked in cheese. Do I really need to say more?Max n Cheese- Truffle mac and cheese, again a no brainer. Pork Stuffed Piquillo Peppers- These were probably my favorite. The pepper itself was very delicate and subtle which let the pork, cheese, and chimichurri sauce shine through. Bonus! GF friends can enjoy these too. When it came to the entrees Asia suggested the Southern Fried Chicken, Shrimp & Grits, or the Cracklin' Chicken & Risotto. Everyone at the table did the fried chicken except for myself (I got the Fried Chicken & Champagne Cobb Salad). Which by the way, still had fried chicken so it counts. I never thought I would say this, but the chicken was better than Babe's. I KNOW! But the inside was so perfectly tender and seasoned beautifully with just the right amount of crisp on the skin. It was honestly some of the best I've ever had. Even the side of collard greens and mashed potatoes had great flavor.

They were extremely efficient at clearing tables and seating tables, which was impressive. Most Dallas restaurants are notorious for sophomoric service and slow seating regarding the host stand, so definitely a nice change of pace.We started off with an old world red wine flight (See posted picture). 2 of 4 really spoke to me and my companion. Specifically the Bichot Viellies Vignes Burgundy and the Fontecuoia Sangiovese Reserve. The former would be good for an afternoon gala. The latter was just good, plain and simple.Next came the spinach dip. It was spinach, in a cheese sauce, with bacon bits and another non-descript white cheese on top in a mound, surrounded by too thin tortilla chips. Mixed it all in and it was very delicious. Too much for two people, but definitely good. I tend to prefer my spinach and artichoke dips thicker, with more of the select vegetable, but this was your standard fair.From there we split a Max & Cheese, and a straight order of Max's Fried Chicken. My companion voraciously ate the Max & Cheese, but graciously left me half. It was everything a pricey mac & cheese should be. I've paid more for worse, so was pleasantly surprised.The fried chicken was large, moist, and just enough frying. It was too dark, with just enough crackle. The collard greens were good, larger leaf so less out-of-a-can-ish. The mash potatoes, while sadly small in total, were delicious. The toast was your standard. My companion did not like the honey sweet chili dipping sauce, but I thought it was fitting. Just wasn't interested this evening.We added an additional glass of the Sangiovese from before (See, told you it was good!), and a Finca Del Sur Malbec. Both were good, but I'm prone to the lower prices Malbec's; I haven't found greater quality or flavor in anything beyond store bough. Definitely can't say the same of the Sangiovese; it was worth every penny.Service overall was friendly, helpful, and relatively timely.My one star off is for the menu; it's all oil, grease, or cream based.

I ordered the \"Southern Chicken Benedict,\" and I was really excited to try it \u00a0because it was a unique and southern twist to my favorite brunch dish. Think cornbread instead of english muffin, fried chicken instead of ham, and collared greens instead of spinach. SUPER YUM RIGHT? Unfortunately, I can't quite say that. I'd give the fried chicken itself 4 stars, tasty and not dry at all. There was also a little spicy kick to it. However, the dish overall was really salty. It's surprisingly a very heavy dish too, even though it doesn't come with any sides. Based on the first bite alone, I was a fan, but by the time I finished, it was just a little too much and too salty for me to enjoy.Overall, I'm glad I tried the food here, but not sure if I would come back again until they tweak the saltiness level of their food.

My friend ordered the sliders which again was a nice serving but the chicken was extremely overdone and very dry. He also ordered the \u00a0homemade chips which were good and a side of mac and cheese. It was unique. I'm not sure it was my favorite but it was okay. Not sure I'll return anytime soon. I would have ordered a glass of wine but I thought it was a little pricey as well. The server was nice and somewhat apologetic that they were out of there \u00a0bison chili.

It was a Sunday brunch on the patio at 11:15 and they had only one guy working- it wasn't his fault, just poor planning. Our drinks came at strange and late times but he also gave a few for free so that helped! I had the chicken friend chicken waffle- gravy on the side add syrup. It was fantastic! I also suggest trying their honey chipotle sauce, it was great with the chicken! Mimosas $3 and not too bad, good ratio of oj to champs. I will definitely be back, their chicken is to die for!"}, {"rating": 3.0, "date": "11/8/2015", "text": "So this is my second time coming to MAX's Wine Dive. And the first time in Dallas (I tried the Austin location many years ago and apparently forgot to review that location but my memory, unfortunately, has an expiration date).What I do remember was that MAX's Wine Dive in Austin wasn't that great - and it was pretty generic. And I understood that to be the hallmark of a chain restaurant. What I did not realize was that the \"chain\" is actually a small one, with pretty much one location for every main Texan city (and one in Denver). And I didn't realize that it also started in Houston. Regardless, I remember leaving the New Year Eve celebration thinking that the food was not very ingenious and that it tasted mass-produced.Fast forward two years to today, I can tell you that the brunch is better. I do have some gripes though - with the primary one being that they did not offer much in the menu in ways of proteins. There was only two dishes that had proteins - and they both consisted of fried chicken. The rest were just heavy on carbs (and no, I don't really count the eggs and bacon as proteins on the same level as the meats). But as far as it tasted, it tasted pretty good. Not great, but pretty good.I ordered the Fried Chicken platter which is jalape\u00f1o-buttermilk marinated, deep fried slow and low, served with mashed potatoes, collard greens and Texas toast. That's what the menu said, at least. And what I got was good collard greens that had been cooked in apple cider vinegar, good mashed potatoes, bland toast (not buttered enough, and it wasn't served with butter, jam, or any spread), and good fried chicken - one dark leg, and one white breast. The leg won over the breast over the flavor, since I didn't think the breast was marinated long enough and it came out a little bit too dry the farther in you eat into it. At least, most of the meal was good, and you'd be full before you could eat everything.I also tried a friend of mine's Fried Egg Sandwich which consists of artisan sourdough, three fried eggs, applewood-smoked bacon, Gruy\u00e8re, Bibb lettuce, tomatoes and truffle oil, served with truffle chips. Even though there's no chicken here, and these ingredients are pretty very basic. Basic enough that I could make this at home actually (the truffle flavor infused oil tastes similar to mine. If you don't have one, you should get it ASAP. Order it at Amazon if you have to). However, it did come out tasty, even though the person who ordered it complained that her egg yolk wasn't made over easy, or runny enough.I also shared the MAX 'n Cheese, which is the cavatappi pasta tossed in truffle cream with provolone, Gruy\u00e8re and Parmigiana Reggiano. And I thought it tasted good - the mix of cheeses were a good blend. And it's always awesome to have a hint of truffle thrown into the mix. So really, I can't complain about this one even if I wanted to. My other friend, who is pickier than I am, tried to comment on it being too cheesy, but we laughed since we knew that all mac and cheese are cheesy by default. Overall, this was a good mac and cheese. If anything, I would have liked it more if the pasta was a tad bit more al dente. It was not mushy, but it wasn't al dente either. It was almost-mushy. Perhaps they could try toasting it with the cheese more before applying the truffle oil. But that's just me being picky on perfecting what is already a decent mac and cheese.Would I come back? I wouldn't mind. The mimosas were good. Service was friendly. And overall plates were tasty even though the food is not at the point where it should be to become a foodie destination. As for the price points, they're a little more higher than what I would like to see, but then again, the portions are much bigger than what I would have desired. I guess that's the American Dream, isn't it?"}, {"rating": 5.0, "date": "11/7/2015", "text": "Went here for Saturday brunch, it was AMAZING! My friend and I both got chicken and waffles...

Please let me know when you would like to come back in and we will provide the experience that you should have received yesterday.\" I very much appreciate this, if we do go back I look forward to giving Max's the opportunity to show their stuff, but to be honest it will be awhile before we go again, there's just too many other options to try first. But 5 stars for customer service. This place was so incredibly disappointing. So much so that while I haven't yelped in awhile, I felt compelled to write one for this place. The fried chicken is fine. That ends the positives about the food. The jalape\u00f1o cornbread is $6 plain-tasting cornbread that has an odd tasting butter that potentially has some spice but no not really. Pass on that. Get ready for the worst Caesar Salad of your life. You get four large crotons, which is of course pointless bc you either have to cut them up or eat them separate bc you can't get salad and them and chicken in one bite. Also mine were stale... My chicken was cold. So I took it home to try in the microwave and tried to just eat the lettuce and dressing and a piece of my bf's fried chicken which was hot. The Caesar Dressing has no flavor. I can't even explain it except you're just eating wet calories on lettuce. So for $16 I basically ate 4 stale croutons. $16 dollars. Insanity. The bf got the fried chicken which again, was good, nothing special, juicy, ok maybe better than good, but worth $20? gtfoh. Texas toast? No... it's white bread. There is no Texas to the toast. Collard greens? not good. I've had better made while camping. Home fries or whatever they were? would have been good but they put the crispy potatoes under the sloppy collard greens so they were soggy. We didn't bother getting alcohol since a mimosa is a $5 champagne flute. GTFOH. Stop pretending bc it's uptown this is acceptable, State & Allen has better food and $2.50 mimosas. The Rustic gives you a variety of foods and a carafe of mimosas for less than our total for this meal, which again, for fried chicken and a chicken Caesar salad, cornbread and one coke was $45 before tip. This was the worst meal we've had since moving to Dallas, because the food was meh and the price was ridiculous. I have no problem paying $50 for brunch if the food is worth it, this was a joke and the chef should be ashamed because no one with a culinary bone in their body would taste that chicken Caesar salad and feel like a good human charging $16 for it, or $20 for that chicken meal. Save your money, there's a million other restaurants around here that do the same stuff better. I gave them two stars because the staff was nice, although I had to ask for my drink twice.

There were 3 courses to choose from on the list.For her, she chose the stuffed pulled pork peppers as the first, shrimp and grits as the second, and bread pudding as her third. \u00a0The shrimp and grits came with a white wine (forgot the name since I don't like white wines), and the pulled pork peppers came with a baby Beaujolais.For me, I chose the short rib sliders, fried chicken, and the fruit & cheese plate to finish. The sliders came with a Malbec, and the fried chicken came with champagne! (Obviously. I love sparkling wines and reds, so I was very happy with my pairings.)First Course: We both liked the first courses. The stuffed peppers were delicious with the pulled pork combination and the little dollops of chipotle aioli and chimichurri sauce. \u00a0The sliders were very tender and meaty, though neither of us really tasted the garlic white cheddar spread or noticed any arugula on ours. Still, they were just the right portion and tasted great.Second Course: I thought the fried chicken was excellent. Nice, crispy batter that wasn't overly crunchy or dry and was soaked in some of the meat juices that were coming out of the meat as I was eating. Great flavor. My friend thought so, too. \u00a0The mashed potatoes were nice and buttery. The collard greens were oddly spicy and tart, but when I ate them with the mashed potatoes, they went well together. \u00a0To top it off, a nice fat slice of triangular Texas Toast sat on the edge of my plate. \u00a0However, my friend was only so-so on her shrimp and grits. The presentation was lovely, but the texture was soupier than she was used to. \u00a0The butter broth was not spicy, which was fine by us, but it made the texture of the grits less than authentic Southern style, in my opinion. \u00a0(Yes, Max's serves Southern with a twist, but I guess I'm just picky on grits!) \u00a0The poached egg and generous helping of bacon pieces worked well with the rest of the dish. \u00a0The shrimp we could have done without, as they were a little tough. \u00a0My friend disliked having to shell and take the tails off of her own shrimp, so we had different views on the flaws on that dish.Third Course: \u00a0The bread pudding was underwhelming, and that's a significant reason why Max's only gets a 3-star rating from me. \u00a0The top was too hard, and the rest of the chunk of bread pudding was a little drier than expected, almost like the dessert was baked too long without enough sauce in the cake itself or any to pour on top. \u00a0The ice cream helped a little, but we didn't end up finishing that dessert. \u00a0The fruit and cheese plate was delicious! \u00a0I enjoyed the bleu and the cheddar, while my friend just had the cheddar and more of the fruits.All in all, my rating is a 3. \u00a0I would come back to try the other non-RW items on the menu if it were for a party or if my friends suggested it, but I would not be the one to suggest this to others. \u00a0What I liked best were the fried chicken, the wine pairings, and the fruit & cheese plate. \u00a0They do fried chicken and champagne well, which is a good thing, since that's in their slogan."}, {"rating": 2.0, "date": "8/10/2015", "text": "I came here because I was told that there is this trendy place that sells great southern food with a twist.

Now with such a big crowd I was very interested to see what was on their menu. When it comes to going to southern food restaurants. I tend to be uninterested. It tends to be over priced and unnecessary due to the fact I can make it better in my own kitchen for a lesser price. Looking at the menu, I will have to be honest I was not impressed. 22.00 for shrimp and grits, 19.00 for chicken, 15.00 for tomato soup and grilled cheese. Ummm okay. There were other items but you get the point. I landed on the fried chicken because I saw so many others with it on their tables. I figured there has to be something to this chicken! Let me stop being a bougie Debbie downer. Now I did order this excellent Bossio Moscato. Their wine selection does not disappoint. If anything going out for some drinks to this place is something I can see myself doing often. Back to the food. The chicken comes with mashed potatoes topped with greens. There was a side of honey which I assumed was for the chicken. The chicken was tender and fried ok. The flour and the chicken was not seasoned. I put the honey on the chicken which I immediately regretted. The honey would make sense if there was some sort of salty flavor to it. The waitress asked if I wanted hot sauce and I said yes thinking that the hot sauce would add some sort of salty vinegar taste that would make this all better. The hot sauce was not of the Louisiana hot sauce or Red Hot family, but I believe it was Cholula. Which ended up doing nothing for me or the chicken in my opinion. The sides... well mashed potatoes you really can't go wrong with. I just could of used some flavor. I guess that was suppose to come from the greens on top of it, but no it did not. I was suppose to get bread with my plate and I did not. I don't think it would have help anyways. The waiter was nice but also seemed to busy and uninterested. My friend ordered fries and didn't even get them. All in all I could have stayed home and made all of these items and could have been more satisfied.

The meat was juicy and cooked all the way through.As the smile on my face and taste buds were grinning from ear to ear i realized i still had my own plate to start eating. Two eggs on top, sunny side up is how i like it. There were chunks of turkey, cranberries, stuffing and gravy below the eggs all cooked in a cast iron skillet where i was warned of the heat it contained by our waiter.

SO and I came here tonight to celebrate a really good friend's birthday. I suggested place because the menu sounded great! Walking in, there was live music - one woman singing with a mic, her guitar and a tip jar. Wonder if they even paid her. Scenery was loud, a wall of various wines which is expected, and they also have a bar with other cocktails, alcohol and beer. Let's get to the food: we had their signature fried chicken (comes with a thigh, leg and a breast; extra breast is $6, extra thigh is $4) with tangy collard greens, mashed potatoes and half a toast at room temp. The fried chicken was good. It was an in between of Babe's and Church's. We asked for the honey chipotle dip and all it was is honey with a small kick. Collards greens were not that great. Cold and extra tangy if you guys enjoy that then have at it. The mashed potatoes were run of the mill taters. The portion was $17 but we were able to share it between the two of us. But if you are super hungry, one person could easily finish the plate. My friend had the swordfish with pumpkin that I got to try and it was pretty tasty. Nothing special or unique. She also ordered the \"Max and cheese\" and it was really good, came with a creamy cheesy sauce. I think it was big enough for two to share and have a good anion but we shared it amongst 5 others. Overall, food was good but overpriced, which is expected for location and ambiance. Service was okay but the waiter failed to refill our waters when we were out. The reason why we deducted points for this place was their DESSERT SERVING FEE. Just a WARNING:They charge $2 per person whether you eat or do not eat, as long as you are seated with the party, you will be charged. All this fee includes is an extra small plate, a fork and a knife to cut the cake. The manager claims the host/hostess was supposed to let parties know that is what they do here but we were never told that. The person who brought the cake even checked in with the host/hostess. We were also sitting in next to the host area by the front door. The waiter acted clueless as to what happened and got the manager for us. Poor communication and the manager not being accommodating to our situation lost our business. He was quite rude about it but we did pay for it. We just didn't find it fair to charge a person $2 when she just came in to say hi for about 10 minutes while we finished a slice of cake.

Wrong. \u00a0 The sandwich was so greasy that it was impossible to eat with my hands. \u00a0The \"bacon\" was actually a think slice of what appeared to be mystery meat (think Salisbury steam from high school cafeteria) that was so tough you had to cut it with a steak knife. \u00a0 It had ok flavor, but the presentation and grease was a huge turn off. \u00a0The chips were good, however. \u00a0 My friend had the MWD Southern Fried Chicken, and he reported that it was cold and the chicken was stringy (meaning it had been frozen). \u00a0The mashed potatoes were stiff and cold, but the greens were warm and swimming in grease. \u00a0 I've had that MWD classic many times before, and this one simply was not up to standard in any way. \u00a0 Finally, a note about the space itself. \u00a0 The Houston location is warm and cozy and decorated to make you feel like it has been there for years, even though it is in a relatively new strip center on Washington Avenue. \u00a0 The McKinney location is at least three times the size, with none of the charm. \u00a0 I felt as if some nameless corporation had taken a cool inner-city restaurant concept and grossed-it up for the suburbs and mass produced it. \u00a0 Kind of like a Planet Hollywood experience. \u00a0 The place needs a serious upgrade in management too, as there were boxes of food and other items stacked along the hallway leading to the kitchen and along the walls in the back room. \u00a0 With all that space, can't you store things in the back of the house? \u00a0 The men's bathroom was a disaster - paper towels on the floor, cleaning supplies sloppily stored under the sink cabinet, etc. \u00a0 As I say, I was truly disappointed with this visit. \u00a0 Hopefully MWD management will pay some attention to this location to bring it up to standards, because if not I fear for the success of this location. \u00a0 I for one won't be rushing to go back without some major changes."}, {"rating": 1.0, "date": "9/10/2014", "text": "Six of us had dinner here.

The service was great: they were really accommodating even though we had to push our reservation back, and our server was super attentive and sweet. However, the \"unlimited\" juice was kind of a lie. They brought us the bottle of champagne (for 4 people), and only gave us two tiny glasses of juice, one with orange and one with grapefruit juice. Each glass was probably enough to make one mimosa for one person. Most of us really only wanted to drink the orange juice, but it was gone in a few seconds and they kept bringing us back that stupid tiny glass. We ended up having to drink really gross, strong mimosas by the end of brunch because we were tired of waiting for juice refills. So...they're stingy on juice, for sure.As a table, we ordered the cinnamon rolls, creme brulee french toast, chicken fried steak & waffles, chicken wings & waffles, and red velvet pancakes. All came in pretty large portions but were not that tasty. The cinnamon rolls were so sweet that I could only take a small bite, the creme brulee french toast was nothing special (I enjoyed the fresh cut strawberries on the plate more than I enjoyed the actual french toast), chicken fried steak tasted good but was mostly breading, chicken wings were ok (I'd prefer not to have to deal with bones though), and the red velvet pancakes were dry, too large and carb-y, and didn't taste much like red velvet.Overall, good service, but mediocre food and stingy on the OJ."}, {"rating": 3.0, "date": "8/28/2014", "text": "Wow.

My friends obliged.Aside from that two of us ordered the cinnamon rolls, chicken fried steak & waffle, and creme brulee french toast. The other two of us ordered the chicken wings & waffle and red velvet pancakes (RVP). The mimosa juices came in these small bottles that eventually were filled less and less. The last time, I think it was the manager, brought us a half-filled bottle of juice. So it's unlimited juice but they get stingier about it. Alright then. The cinnamon rolls were okay. They almost seemed like pure sugar. The best part of the chicken fried steak & waffle was the breading on the steak. The french toast didn't really have any creme brulee part to it. The RVP were HUGE and less red velvety than I had hoped. The chicken wings & waffle were pretty good, awesome chicken with decent waffle. My eyes were definitely too big for my stomach so that might've hindered the experience.

I'm thinking you charge me for the part of the cancelled order I actually ate not the meal someone else bailed on.

Anyways, I finally decided on the French toast, which was odd to me cause I've eaten French toast like twice in my entire life. I picked it mainly because of the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e aspect. I love creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. My hubby got the short rib burrito. I cannot complain one bit about the French toast. I was moist and fluffy at the same time with just the right amount of sweetness. The maple syrup it came with was just the right consistency. Topped with fresh strawberries, yum! My hubby enjoyed his short rib burrito, although the portion was huge!

We sat down and there were a max of 4 other tables in the restaurant, so we were hoping for fast and attentive service. Apparently this is too much to ask for from Max's Wine Dive. Our waiter did not even refill our water after being asked two times, he did not acknowledge his slow service or apologize for forgetting his only table two times. We ordered two apps both which they were out of... the wine pour was unbelievably short. My friend ordered the lavender cocktail which sounded amazing in description but when it came out it tasted like a heavily scented candle. We told our server that we didn't like it, were more than happy to pay for it but wanted to get a glass of wine instead. He acted like this was such an inconvenience for him, he replied that is not the drink he would have suggested but made no effort to stop her from getting this misleading cocktail. The food took almost an hour to hit the table and keep in mind we cant even get a water refill while we are waiting. I didn't even bother to order a second glass of wine because it seemed to be too much trouble for the staff. The manager on duty was walking by and could see that we were very unhappy, asked how everything was and I let him know how long we had been waiting for our food, that they were out of the things we came in for, and that clearly there was no water or drinks in anyone glasses. He didn't even seem bothered or shocked by this, almost as if this was the norm. He said \" yeah i mean sunday nights are slow because of the brunch crowd?\" What does this have to do with the night service being awful after that when its dead and there isnt a million tables and orders keeping the kitchen and staff buys...Sad because the food when it did come out is pretty decent but unfortunately I will never be back.

They were extremely efficient at clearing tables and seating tables, which was impressive. Most Dallas restaurants are notorious for sophomoric service and slow seating regarding the host stand, so definitely a nice change of pace.We started off with an old world red wine flight (See posted picture). 2 of 4 really spoke to me and my companion. Specifically the Bichot Viellies Vignes Burgundy and the Fontecuoia Sangiovese Reserve. The former would be good for an afternoon gala. The latter was just good, plain and simple.Next came the spinach dip. It was spinach, in a cheese sauce, with bacon bits and another non-descript white cheese on top in a mound, surrounded by too thin tortilla chips. Mixed it all in and it was very delicious. Too much for two people, but definitely good. I tend to prefer my spinach and artichoke dips thicker, with more of the select vegetable, but this was your standard fair.From there we split a Max & Cheese, and a straight order of Max's Fried Chicken. My companion voraciously ate the Max & Cheese, but graciously left me half. It was everything a pricey mac & cheese should be. I've paid more for worse, so was pleasantly surprised.The fried chicken was large, moist, and just enough frying. It was too dark, with just enough crackle. The collard greens were good, larger leaf so less out-of-a-can-ish. The mash potatoes, while sadly small in total, were delicious. The toast was your standard. My companion did not like the honey sweet chili dipping sauce, but I thought it was fitting. Just wasn't interested this evening.We added an additional glass of the Sangiovese from before (See, told you it was good!), and a Finca Del Sur Malbec. Both were good, but I'm prone to the lower prices Malbec's; I haven't found greater quality or flavor in anything beyond store bough. Definitely can't say the same of the Sangiovese; it was worth every penny.Service overall was friendly, helpful, and relatively timely.My one star off is for the menu; it's all oil, grease, or cream based. The mashed potatoes were the only untouched starch amongst it all.

Such is life. Just make sure you ask the price of everything you order because we had some major upselling without being aware of the extra cost. \u00a0We had the pepper appetizer - amazing. \u00a0I couldn't taste the chimichurri at all but it was one of my favorite dishes. \u00a0There was a PILE of green garnish on top which did not make sense or add to the dish at all, but I would order these again. Sadly, not so much for the fried brussel sprouts. Of the two types, the romesco sauce was \"meh\"; the lemon confit, port glazed was the best and I would ask for an entire plate of that instead of mixing. \u00a0These were unlike the fried Brussels I have had before in that it was a whole half of a sprout that was fried instead of the leaves or smaller pieces. \u00a0Order more peppers instead. One in our party ordered a glass of champagne that the waiter suggested. He did not tell us that it was $30 a glass and we should have asked. One in our party ordered the chicken sliders as his meal. The waiter suggested ordering fries to round out the meal. The fries did not arrive until after the sliders were done and then they were so hot no one could eat them, plus he had finished his meal. No worry, but I must say I was shocked that the fries cost $6. That is more than half the price of the sliders. Two of us ordered fried chicken and one ordered gluten free fried chicken. \u00a0The fried chicken is $16 and the upcharge for gluten free, which we were not told about, was $4 more - \u00a0adding \u00bc of the price of the dish. We would have ordered it anyway but it was yet again another charge that was added without telling us. \u00a0In addition, I asked that no gravy be put on my mashed potatoes and the waiter said that no gravy came on it but we could order it on the side. He failed to mention that was an additional $3. We had closed our menus at that time and didn't see it - it is under \"add to any dish\" now that I look at it online. \u00a0 \u00a0I am from the South and I know my way around fried chicken and greens and usually restaurants cannot do it justice. However, this fried chicken was fabulous. \u00a0I have also ordered a lot of greens lately and they all have been sadly lacking. \u00a0These greens rocked!! As in other reviews, the chicken pieces were small - the leg was only about 3 inches long, smaller than a lipstick tube, and the breast was about half the size of a normal chicken breast but it was all so good and we were filling up bc of the two appetizers. \u00a0 Everyone that worked there was very nice but we did get some slow down and strangely a little attitude from one food runner. \u00a0We had a party of four on a round top and with two appetizers, our plates, and wine glasses; we were a little tight for room. No one cleared the appetizer plates but they brought out our entrees. \u00a0He is standing there with our entrees and wants to put them on the table, although where he thought he was going to do that, I didn't know. When I asked the guy if they could take away the appetizer mess before they put our entrees down because there was no room, he was extremely put out. Even though there was an 8-10 top empty table behind him that he could have put our dishes on, he literally GRUNTED at me because of the suggestion. We began piling our plates on top of each other and bussing our own table to make room for him. The hostess came over and was so sweet to take our plate pile away. \u00a0This was a week night and it wasn't particularly packed so I was surprised \u00a0but really more at the attitude than the fumble. \u00a0We had two desserts, one which I can't remember what it was and it's not on the menu online but it was good, and the other which was a pecan bread pudding - leaden. Skip that. \u00a0They gave the birthday girl a glass of champagne on the house. Nice. The atmosphere was fun, our waiter was great, \u00a0and our bill for three entrees, \u00a0three appetizers with all the upselling and without tip was almost $200. This includes three glasses of wine at appx $8/9 each and two glasses of champagne but I subtracted the price of the the cute tshirt we bought with the slogan - \"Champagne and Fried Chicken - why the hell not?\" \u00a0With that and tip, my bill was close to $250. We had a great time, the food was great with a few missteps, and I would come back - but I would order carefully. \u00a0I thought I was saving money by not going to III Forks for this birthday dinner but not so much. \u00a0Still dreaming of the chicken and greens tho......"}, {"rating": 3.0, "date": "3/1/2014", "text": "I think Max's best feature is the location/parking.

It's in its own little skillet which is cute. They tore up the bacon and poked it through...not sure why. The pot pie has home-style fries, collard greens, cream sauce, provolone, bacon, a crust, and two fried eggs. The flaky crust was weird. It was basically like phyllo dough which is irritating to cut through when dry. My eggs weren't runny at all, which I was unsure about. I'm not sure the provolone was necessary for me, since the cream sauce gave enough creaminess. The collard greens had a nice flavor to them. A little spicy and a little sweet. The potatoes were good too. Overall a good dish.

I really wanted to try the chicken and waffles, but instead, I had the fried chicken, mash potatoes, and greens. Dessert? Bread pudding. I have to say...seeing the Tony Romo turnover dessert on the menu? I was cracking up. I love it! Giants for life!!!! Anyway back to the food. Excellent presentation, wonderful service from a cute waitress. The fried chicken was delicious. Great flavor, sufficient crunch. Loved the mash, and with the mixture of the salt from the greens, made it extra special. I cleaned that plate. To end things, I tried the bread pudding. Normally, kinda hate this stuff, but that bourbon sauce tho? That's a nice touch. It was delicious and just what I needed. I left there full and satisfied. The best thing to do after you eat there?

The Red Velvet Pancakes are huge. The Bacon is awesome. The steak and eggs meal is delicious too. The greens are great.... I mean everything. I only wish the meals were more of a meal. For instance, the Red Velvet Pancakes come with butter but it'd be great if they'd take away one of the 3 huge pancakes and serve some eggs or meat with it. I usually just pay the extra side item fee and create meals the way I want them anyway. It's always good. The Chef is usually standing in the food window sending plates back that aren't up to his standards and asking why things are taking so long. He definitely gets that back of the house. I've never had a problem with seating but I've seen others wait and wait. I sit at the bar and watch the magic from the kitchen. The atmosphere is great.

For the price ($16) and the hype surrounding it, I expected a lot more bang for one of the cheapest and most ubiquitous menu items found in the Southern U.S.One thing that did stand out was wide variety of portion sizes among menu items. Was with a group that ordered a number of different entrees and although the fried chicken was plated well, other dishes ranged from small appetizer-sized servings to one large enough to feed three people.

I loved everything we ordered which was their Famous Fried Chicken that came with mashed potatoes, and greens, and we ordered cream corn and their Mac and Cheese mmmmm all delicious.

What a difference from the last time. For one thing, our reservation was at 11 and the restaurant wasn't even half way full. The other times I've visited it was packed. And to put it bluntly, the service sucked. Our server, who at times slipped into a British accent mid sentence was not friendly in the least. In fact, his manner was that we were bothering him. The accent thing was confusing too...maybe he's a wanna be actor?!? \u00a0He wasn't very good at listening either because we would ask for something and get something else. \u00a0The food was fantastic as usual, thankfully. Well, except my husbands. He ordered the Short Rib Hash, which our server didn't even know was on the menu. Everything in the dish was hot except for the short ribs. After finally getting our servers attention, my husband told him the meat was cold. Instead of apologizing and sending over a manager, which is SOP, he just said I'll get that fixed for you. So while the rest of us (3) ate our brunch my husband waited...and waited. My plate had been removed before my husband finally got his replacement dish. Later, after sending the water/coffee girl for our check, we finally got it. Our server never checked back with us after delivering my husband's food. My husband asked to speak with a manager and waited and waited. Finally, our server told us she was busy and it would be a few more minutes. By this time however, we were over it. My husband told him never mind and we paid and left. I recently saw Groupons for Max's and I thought it was odd that such a successful place needed to use Groupons because usually only places trying to build their businesses use them. Now I understand why. Needless to say, we won't be returning.

A little annoyed that they wouldn't seat us, but I guess they take reservations seriously. (kinda nice this day and time). The bar service was kinda slow and when the server got to us, he wasn't very adept at explaining the happy hour menu and how it worked. The short version is that bottles of wine are sold at the retail price during happy hour. Not the normal restaurant markup. It's still more than you would pay at Spec's, but a steal for a restaurant.

If she picked up on a piece of a conversation thread she would seamlessly contribute to it in a positive way. For example, once when she came to the table, she overheard us discussing places to hang out at The Shops at Legacy. Picking up on our lack of knowledge about the area, she offered a couple suggestions.When someone was having trouble deciding what to order, she asked what the choices were between and offered her comments and suggestions. I know it's not terribly uncommon for a server to offer suggestions on the menu, but I've been at some of the nicer restaurants in Dallas where servers still had not mastered this art.What really won my heart, though, is when she brought the hot sauce that I forgot to ask for.

It looked interesting driving by so when it came up on Groupon, I checked out the menu and picked up several certificates given that the menu had multiple options that sounded good. Tonight was our first experience there. After a long day at work, it had gotten late so I needed to see how late they were open. I clicked on the link \"Locations & Hours\" and selected Dallas, but alas, no hours were listed there. I had to Google for it, and there is a page with hours on it, but it's under reservations, though not the reservations link offered. So turns out they were open until midnight. Great! We arrived at 10pm, were greeted by an energetic manager who sat us right away. Our waiter was considerably more low key, but competent. Not being big wine people, we ordered iced tea. We consulted the menu and ordered the drunken bread as a starter. After a tremendously long wait, it arrived. It was awesome. Bread, crispy golden cheese edges, what's not to like? For dinner, my companion ordered the fried chicken, $15, and substituted Mac and Cheese for the collard greens at a $3 up-charge. I got the burger which claimed to be a combination of 4 meats/cuts with cheddar and bacon. The \"applewood smoked bacon\" was an insane $4 up-charge, while cheese was listed as $2 extra, though the description of the burger included \"your choice of cheese.\" (On their website, the menu has the same description including cheese, and the $2 option is a fried egg.) After another long wait, the food arrived. I ordered the burger medium and while it wasn't apparent initially, it was basically well done. It may have been because it was overcooked, but it just wasn't a $21 burger. Tillman's Roadhouse has a much better burger for the same price. The bacon was completely crispy which is rare and welcome, but it was ultimately nothing special for the insane price. The cheese was good and a good portion. The roll was good. Apparently these are all locally sourced, but that doesn't justify the price to me. Make it a $19 burger and include those things. Psychologically, it would be better. I guess the chicken was good, and not badly priced. The Mac and cheese was quite good, but the cavatapi pasta (spiral-elbow) made it difficult to eat as it was hard to pick it up without it falling off the fork/spoon) For dessert, we tried the \"Sweet Corn Cheesecake\" on oat crust with carmel corn. We interpreted it to be a sweet-corn cheesecake (like a sweet corn cake/bread), but there was no indication the cheesecake contained any corn essence. So perhaps it referred instead to the carmel corn being sweet. It was good, and at $8, all their desserts were well priced. When the manager came over to scan our group on, I mentioned the cheese being included in the burger description. She said something about a misprint, but happily took it off. (If it's a misprint, then edit the menu... they're paper inserts in menu covers, it's not difficult.) Dinner took almost 2 hours, and not because we failed to order in a timely manner. Maybe if we were enjoying an expensive bottle of wine, we'd want to hang out, but we weren't. I don't necessarily like being processed through restaurants in 45min including dessert, but 2 hours is a bit extreme considering they were far from packed. Also, they are oddly aggressive with refilling your water glasses... to the point that an empty tea glass was filled with water. And we were asked at least 3 times after dessert if we needed more water, even though we were drinking our tea and had three glasses of water on the table already. So we have two more groupons and will be back to use them and try other things. But aside from the drunken bread and mac-n-cheese, it's unlikely I would come here at full price."}, {"rating": 4.0, "date": "7/3/2013", "text": "Loved this place, only reason for less than 5 stars is due to the very bare bones boring outside patio where we were seated.

Let me start by saying the food is phenomenal. Appetizer:Hummus: We ordered this the first time. The hummus has a great flavor but they served it with tortilla chips which is weird, and took away from the goodness of the hummus.Pan Borracho:Yes. Do it. They advertise this as a \"savory bread pudding.\" Please don't let that turn you off like it did me the first visit. What they should say is a wonderful bread w/ all types of savory seasonings and drowning in amazing broth, with a generous layer of cheese melted over all of it. \u00a0I conceded to order this because I was outnumbered in a group. And man I'm glad I was. \u00a0This will be a must everytime I go now. We were all fighting over the last little bit and one of us (*ahem) may or MAY NOT have scraped the empty bowl a little bit to make sure none of it went to waste.Fried Chicken:A must here. Probably THE best fried chicken I've ever had. It definitely blows pretentious Sissy's outta the water. Those mouthwatering golden fried bits of heaven are something I dream about and crave all the time now that I've had it done right. The seasoning in this batter is perfectly subtle, but SO tasty you just know they have a secret recipe back there. \u00a0The greens are really good and flavorful and I love the southern touch of throwing some Texas Toast in with it all. The only thing that doesn't impress about this dish is the mashed potatoes. They're pretty bland and not very thick or creamy.Shrimp and grits:If you're not a fried chicken fan, or just in the mood for something else, this is your dish. These shrimp were huge and deliciously sauteed, while the grits are probably the creamiest, most wonderful flavorful grits I've ever had. \u00a0Thank God my sister and I decided to share this plate along w/ the fried chicken or I definitely would've had serious order envy.Haute Dog:Unless you're a dude who just likes big nasty hot dogs, skip this. It looks like a big plate of mush and when I tasted it, there wasn't much special about it in my opinion. They are so many other delicous things on the menu that trump this thing.Drinks:They have a very impressive wine menu along w/ descriptions for the flavors/body, etc for the wine. I love this because it really helps me order something I know I'll like. In addition, the servers are all really well versed in the wine menu and are very helpful when you ask for a recommendation.That being said, the service has been great both times we've gone. My biggest complaint was the last guy we had, while not outright rude, was very surly and seemed in a terrible mood all night. He made no effort to talk with us or smile, even when we tried to joke or engage him in conversation. This made it a little awkward for everyone but we got over it.Desserts:Half and half: 1/2 Blonde brownie and 1/2 pineapple upside down bread puddingDelicious. Both halves. BUT....I actually prefer that dense, moist blonde brownie on its own. \u00a0That blonde brownie is like a yellow cake on steroids. It's so dense and moist and perfectly delicious. It just melts in your mouth. Overall, super great experience, great ambiance, great food.

I then moved onto the \"beer-wine\" La Socarrada which I must say is a new favorite. For the appetizer, we moved onto the Bruschetta which was soaked in olives and cheese, and eaten in a flash. All around the table, none of our entrees were anything less than delicious. However, if you get one thing, GET THE CLASSIC FRIED CHICKEN. This free range chicken is soaked in buttermilk and jalapeno batter and fried to perfection. It's complimented with mashed potatoes, collared greens, and toast. I ate every bite and was oh so glad I saved up all my calories for this. Impressive! We managed to save room for dessert and our table split the Pineapple Upside Down Cake Bread Pudding and the desert special of the night, some amazing form of gourmet s'mores.

The blonde brownie was anything but moist. You can describe it more as crumbly and brittle. The coffee came cold and then they ran out. Overall the experience was terribly disappointing and didn't leave any room or reason for us to return. \u00a0For an $8 dessert, we regret not going to get frozen Pinkberry yogurt instead"}, {"rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2013", "text": "Max's is amazing and I would recommend this eatery to everyone.

Steak and eggs, chicken-fried steak and waffles, cinnamon rolls, red velvet pancakes, sandwiches, omelets, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9 French toast, etc. I chose the Wild Mushroom and Goat Cheese omelet and it was so simply fantastic. There were literally only 3 ingredients. Eggs. Mushrooms. Goat cheese. It tasted so clean and earthy; these were the greatest most rustic mushrooms ever! Prices are a little up there, but everything is top-notch and the wait staff is so attentive. Your glass will never be empty! I cannot wait to come back and try out Max's for their specialty - WINE.

Go no further, this is the perfect remedy... Over easy egg nestling on top of collard greens and homemade fries, and topped with puff pastry and bacon...

I showed my phone to the manager and it wasn't a problem. I ordered an orange juice mimosa and chicken and waffles. This was my first mimosa, and I'm not much of a drinker, so I didn't really care for it. But the others at our table devoured theirs (and ordered another and another and another), so I'm not a good person to take drink reviews from. I planned to share my cinnamon rolls with everyone because I'm not big on cinnamon rolls, but when they came, I took a bite and didn't wanna share with anyone! It was a plate of 3 small cinnamon rolls. They were a warm and gooey piece of heaven. Honestly, it was the best cinnamon roll I've ever tasted. I will forever order them when I dine at Max's. Reluctantly, I went ahead and shared, in an attempt to not appear greedy. LOL Next came my chicken and waffles. OOOOMMMMGGGGGGG!!!! It was about 6 chicken legs and a good sized waffle. When I tell y'all that this was some of the best foods I've ever eaten....I mean it!! The chicken was seasoned so well. I kept eating well after I was full LOL. I didn't wanna leave anything behind. I ended up asking for a to-go box so that my stomach didn't burst. By the way, I also want to mention how awesome our server Jacob was. He was a pure delight. He was attentive as well as very entertaining. He sang happy birthday to my friend in Latin, in his lovely opera voice. And, he didn't add gratuity to our checks. He said he wants people to tip their own amount, based on how well his service was. I liked that, and tipped him well.

I'm not totally in love with any of the menu items we tried (see below) such that I'll crave them, but we've got another Tidbits deal, so we'll be track to try something else!The pros: Excellent service - our food was out quick, our waitress, CJ, was fantastic, and a manager stopped in to check on us. Top notch! The restaurant has a great vibe, too... is nice and clean, cool decorations... I dig it.The cons: Not a huge fan of the food (at least not what we tried today). We got the cinnamon rolls, the creme brulee french toast, the red velvet pancakes, and the macaroni and cheese. Yes, we pigged out. I'll go from good to bad with the food. The macaroni and cheese is quite tasty - creamy, lots of cheese, and a nice crunchy crust. It's not the best I've had in Dallas, but it's definitely worth trying (although NOT as a meal - the portion is more like that of a large side rather than a meal, so $11 is a bit overpriced for what you get, despite the tastiness). The red velvet pancakes are ENORMOUS (it's as though you're served your own red velvet cake), and the lemon cream cheese 'frosting' adds a lot to the dish. The pancakes themselves are very cakey (I like them a little less fluffy) and rather bland (not a strong cocoa flavor - they definitely needed the lemon frosting). The french toast was also pretty bland, and I wasn't a fan of the strawberries because I think they were soaked in wine (which isn't totally crazy seeing as it's Max's wine dive and all, but I wasn't a fan). \u00a0The only true negative was the cinnamon rolls. The sad part is that they are actually nice and flaky and the first chew tastes good, but then it goes south. \u00a0The problem is that the filling (and perhaps the icing, too) melts out into the skillet and caramelizes, so after the second chew the bolus of food in your mouth starts to feel super sticky, adheres to your teeth, and gloms together with this almost-burnt taste... \u00a0I ended up spitting out into my napkin several balls of caramelized sugar-innards. These cinnamon rolls could be really great if they weren't served in the skillet and allowed to caramelize!For us it's definitely worth going back and trying to find an item we love (chicken and waffles are next on my list), because the service was excellent and we liked the vibe.

Probably the headline about fried chicken - because I love fried chicken. But, the love affair is not to be...First off, I may be a little ditzy, but I walked right past the door to walk in, because it's just a regular door and not marked as anything. There wasn't a logo on it, no hours, no nothing. I thought maybe it was an employee door and shrugged it off and proceeded to walk around the entire corner - only to walk right back, a little sheepishly. A friend of mine was going to meet me and another for some drinks/dinner while he drafted for fantasy. I was able to snag seats at the bar close to an outlet. I'll note now, that if you are in need of an outlet here, the bar would be your only option. There are no outlets by any of the tables. The bar also has hooks! I liked this for my purse. All bottles are available by the glass, but you have to commit to 2 glasses if the menu doesn't list a per glass cost. Follow me? I thought this was kinda cool, but went with a glass of pinot grigio. I'm not crazy picky on wine, and I'm not wine educated, but my wine was served ice cold. I assume a wine place would know, but if ice cold is right, then I've been getting it wrong everywhere else I've ever been. For dinner I went with the fried chicken. It was pretty good, juicy and the breading was crisp. (But if heavily seasoned chicken is your thing, that's not Max's.) The mashed potatoes tasted like day old instant flakes. They were gummy and flavorless. The collard greens were neither here nor there, I ate them and feel neutral about them. I also shared an order of mac and cheese with my friend, and although not a huge mac and cheese fan the order here pleased me. The noodles were al dente and the cheese wasn't over powering. The laced truffle flavor was pleasant.

Unfortunately I'm a terrible friend and estimator of time and didn't show up until probably about 9:15 but thankfully they had already seated my company and she had procured a glass of wine as my stand in.This friend is one of my favorites to eat with because we 1.) have similar tastes, 2.) she will try anything and 3.) we always, always just order multiple things and share. Things we split:MAX n' Cheese - this was truly scrumptious. If they added a dish of this to their menu with their fried chicken on top as an entr\u00e9e, I would be in heaven.Nacho Mama's Oysters - I typically prefer my oysters raw, but I actually really liked this spin on nachos in the form of a perfectly sized fried oyster on a wonton chip.(And of COURSE, why wouldn't we try their famed dish) MAX's Famous Southern Fried Chicken - this was so yummy and an excellent value. There is an option to add an additional piece which our waiter also suggested. I was a little concerned this would be a skimpy portion for this very reason but ours came with either 4 or 5 good sized piece of friend chicken over mashed potatoes and collard greens. We even had a piece and quite a bit of the sides leftover that my friend took to go for a later snack. The batter on this reminded me of (I'm not going to describe this well, so bear with me) almost a shake and bake textured batter rather than what you typically picture of fried chicken. I don't mean this description to cheapen the dish, but definitely as a good thing. I would 100% order this again. The service was pretty good - I think he was a little disenchanted with us when we kept it to glasses versus a bottle, and glasses in the lowest $10 to $11 range at that (a pinot noir for me and a cab sav for her). We asked for a suggestion/sample for our next glasses to which he did quickly cater to, but then went back to upselling our original types of wine. AKA My glass was I think $10 or so and he tried to upsell me to the $15 pinot noir, which I absolutely do not blame him for... but I'm not enough of a wino to pay what I would for a bottle at home for a glass while out.

Like shiraz...with hot dogs. Or in my case, a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup with malbec. However, my sandwich wasn't a normal elementary school kid's lunch - it was a roasted red pepper spread with gruyere and cheddar, making what they call a \"pimiento and cheese\" filling (as in two separate parts, not to be confused with pimiento cheese). Our waiter Garrett was an enthusiastic young man that really wanted my group to have a good time. He made sure we decided on no wine before trying it out, and we ended up choosing a full bodied and flavored Tarrazas malbec that everyone really did enjoy.

We sat outside and asked if the house Grenache was good and the waiter said yes. It was horrible- tasted like it had been left out for a few days; extremely jammy and tasted like a big nasty old raisin. Moving on....the fried oyster nachos were pretty good. Great sauce & spicy kick but they are served on oversized wonton chips that made them difficult to eat. We ended up just eating the oysters. We both ordered the fried chicken which was decent, but no where near as good as Sissy's. The mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box and the collard greens were gross. We also ordered a side of Mac & cheese- meh. Had better. The service was spotty- the waiter was unhelpful, a bit snobby, and rarely around. The bus boy helped us more and was the only person to say \"you're welcome\" when we thanked them for tending to our requests.In conclusion- overpriced, bad service, mediocre food, disappointing wine list.

I probably will not return on my own just because I'm not a wine drinker or an uptown fan, but my friends liked the place."}, {"rating": 4.0, "date": "9/24/2012", "text": "Like any good Uptown resident, I was excited see another brunch spot open as it was sure to be the latest and greatest. \u00a0With two other Texas locations, several Dallas-ites had raved about Max's finally coming to Dallas, but I was a Max's virgin until this past weekend. I went for their famous \"Fried Chicken and Champagne\" Sunday brunch and not that I was sure what to expect, I was expecting table after table with bottles of champagne and plates of steaming hot fried chicken everywhere you turned. \u00a0Could it be a dream come true?We got there at noon and it was PACKED, so take note that you will want to have reservations. \u00a0There was a line of people waiting for a table but the crucial reservations that I had made enabled us to move to the front of the line and be seated right away. \u00a0Tip: They are on open table so make your reservations there and get your points!Our waitress arrived and was immediately not the friendliest and seemed put out that we had to ask the difference between the mimosa that was $6+ dollars and the one that was for $3.75. \u00a0That didnt deter us from ordering them, mine with fresh grapefruit juice and my table-mates with orange juice. \u00a0They were delicious if not small and looking back I wish the waitress wouldnt have pressured us to order our drinks right then before really being able to scope the menu out.On the food front we got the Famous Fried Chicken with Texas toast, collard greens and potatoes as well as Max N' Cheese with truffle oil and gruyere. \u00a0The chicken did not disappoint and is brought with three decently sized pieces. \u00a0However, the collard greens were forgettable and the potatoes overly bland. \u00a0Next, time I'd rather them not clutter my plate. \u00a0The chicken itself was plump and juicy with a extra crunchy crust. \u00a0The Max N Cheese was awesome and there was no shortage of cheesy goodness - but not in the liquidy cheese disgusting way. \u00a0Definitely a must.After one measly mimosa we decided getting a bottle of champagne was the way to go. \u00a0They reduce the prices on the champagne bottles for brunch and then juice comes free so you are MUCH better off. \u00a0Sure it forces you to drink more but...I dont see a problem with that! Overall I was impressed with Max's and will go back. \u00a0For it being the opening week, the food was spot on and so was the decor. \u00a0The only thing I wish we could take back was our unfriendly, eyeliner so thick you couldnt see her eyes waitress. \u00a0The other tables around us seemed to have great servers though!"}, {"rating": 4.0, "date": "9/24/2012", "text": "I've been to this place twice now, for dinner and brunch. I love the concept and had heard nothing but good things from friends and family who had frequented other Texas locations.The service has been great. The staff is friendly and super helpful. There's a large selection with the option of buying by the case, and the atmosphere is fun for any occasion.For dinner, we started with the brussels sprouts - perfectly crunchy bits of chicken-fried deliciousness. The fried chicken was juicy and crunchy with a lingering heat from the jalapeno buttermilk marinade. It was served with collard greens, which were fantastic. Truffle mac was good, but nothing to write home about. Despite D Mag's nasty critique of the pan borracho (drunk bread), it's basically a savory bread pudding and I think it's worth trying.As for the desserts, we tried both the bread pudding and the chocolate brownie. The bread pudding was a little dry, and the devil's food cake was just OK. If you really want a great dessert, go get some Cuatro Leches cake at La Duni.The best part about brunch was the bottle of brut champagne with a carafe of OJ \u00a0(or grapefruit) for $18.99. The creme brulee french toast was good but would have been too dry without syrup. I ordered the \"eggs any style\" with jalapeno grits. The grits were so-so, but I'm not the biggest grits fan. Scrambled eggs were REALLY good. The fruit cup, however, was 90% honeydew, and left a lot to be desired.Definitely check this place out! I'll be back a lot, but if it's during brunch it will more for the social aspect and less for the food."}, {"rating": 4.0, "date": "9/21/2012", "text": "Accomodated our large party...and not only that was very excited about our large party too. Splitting tabs was a non issue, they were happy to split however we wanted it. Staff was soooo great. Ricky Bobby and Tommy - da best! I am still dreaming of the mac & cheese and there was a lot of hub bub about the drunk bread but i didnt try it...which I am now regretting. I only took away a star because its a bit pricey.

The burger itself though once the inconsistency was resolved was really amazing..the brie was something I hadn't had before on a burger but it was a good pair. \u00a0Another friend's order was late coming to the table so they comped her whole meal which was really nice of them.I did find the selection of foods to be kind of strange but was able to find something really good. \u00a0The atmosphere was different...served wine but the interior was kind of rustic and minimal with sports on the tvs. \u00a0All in all I would go back and give it a second try. \u00a0I feel like any issues we had were related to them working the kinks out from being newly opened."}, {"rating": 4.0, "date": "9/17/2012", "text": "The 4 of us came in at 9pm on a Saturday and it was so packed! The hostess said the wait for a table would be 2 hours but we could find a seat at the bar somewhere. We luckily found some seats and asked these two people if they could move down to make room for the four of us. They were very nice about it and then we were on our way to ordering great fried food! We got their chicken special and fried oysters. These were the best fried oysters that I've had anywhere. There was a tangy sauce that was placed under the fried oysters that made it delicious. Usually, there is this gooey and grainy taste to fried oysters done wrong, but this was perfect! The 3 pieces of fried chicken seem to be fried in truffle oil, placed on some collard greens, mash potatoes, and a half thick sliced toast. I wished their toast was more toasted, because it definitely doesn't have the same color as the one shown on their website. This place kicks Sissy's drumsticks!"}, {"rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2012", "text": "I cannot wait to go back! \u00a0Had champagne at happy hour with my friends on the 2nd night it opened. \u00a0Shockingly, the staff was fantastic. \u00a0Super attentive for the amount of people stuffed into the bar, and willing to give recommendations. \u00a0We tried the fried oysters, the Brussels sprouts, the fried chicken sliders and the Max's and Cheese. \u00a0All were really great and would get each again.The dessert was not my favorite (Devil's food cake)-- but it seems like it's different every night, so I'll have to go back and get something different.Happy to have Max's in Dallas and hope that it stays busy enough to pay the rent :)Cheers!"}, {"rating": 4.0, "date": "9/13/2012", "text": "Max's Wine Dive.... I dig it! Good atmosphere with classic rock playing overhead. The staff all were very excited to be open and very friendly. I would say they knew their menu really well. But of course they couldn't have had much of the food yet as the kitchen build out was completed very recently. I sampled nearly all the red wines that were available by the glass. None of them were very exciting. Average price / glass about about $10.25. The bartender tried to charge me for three glasses of wine when really I only committed to two of them. But I did sample over and over. It probably seemed like I had 3 for sure. Max's is a chain; I think they have three other locations. One of the really nice things they have is their standard Max's Classic Menu that's the same at all of their locations. But then each location has a chef specific menu. I really love this concept of having your local chefs inspired creations available. It completely mitigates any argument you could have against a chain restaurant. From the classic menu we had the Pork Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, and let me tell ya, they were awesome! The peppers weren't spicy by my standards but had a terrific flavor and the pulled pork stuffing was slightly sweet, tender and very well put together. With a little chipotle aioli drizzled on the plate they were well worth the $3 a pepper.But the surprise of the night was the Fried Chicken! MMMMMMMm Max's Famous Fried Chicken. I don't even like chicken on the bone, but this was a feast fit for a king. The chicken had awesome flavor, I paired it with a few slices of jalapeno and draped a little of their Chipotle honey dipping sauce on top and WOW delicious! The breading was perfect, slightly tangy peppery, not too thick not too thin, just right. Probably the best fried chicken I've ever had (Sorry Babe's). It came with collard greens on top of mashed potatoes. Personally I would have preferred my greens in a side dish with a little Louisiana sauce and a little bit of gravy for the slightly dry ordinary potatoes. But you can't have everything right?  There isn't much in the way of choices for a vegetarian on the menu. So my veggie gf ended up with the Pumpkin Risotto. For $18 it had better have been something special, It was not. Quite frankly I'm surprised it made it to plate. It wasn't cooked properly (probably overcooked) and lacked unique flavor. Honestly it could have come from a box. But ya know growing pains, and it was their first night. Overall they did pretty well for their first night open to the public. I will certainly return for some Fried Chicken and peppers. But I'll probably skip the wine."}, {"rating": 3.0, "date": "9/13/2012", "text": "Went for the opening night and it was exactly how I thought it would be...food was good, not excellent. I too had the Bison sliders and agree that they were too sweet with the grilled onions...they definitely needed something crunchy to go along with. The wine knowledge of the bartenders was 5 stars...I will be going back to make friends with these guys as I feel I have a lot to learn from them. The only thing I was dissapointed with was the lack of food knowledge from the servers. Restaurant 101 in my mind is KNOW YOUR FOOD on opening night. The waitress admitted, \"we haven't seen most of the food yet since we just opened.\" so when I asked which dressing came out with my salad, she had no idea. This is a simple concept that goes a long way and if the servers say \"I don't know\" that just makes the establishment look dumb and under-trained."}, {"rating": 5.0, "date": "9/11/2012", "text": "How am I writing a review before they open? Well I thought today was the 12th so I stopped in. Come to find out it was friends and family night but, they let me anyway. I have been to the Max's in Houston and loved so, this place had some high expectations but, they met all of them. Real quick, the atmosphere, food and drinks make for a great place! I started off with the bison sliders. Actually, I started off with a glass of champagne. I am not a champagne person but, when everyone's shirts say start off with a glass, you have too. Back to the sliders. They are a great appetizer or even a great small dinner. There are 3 to a serving and taste great! The bison is a little sweet but, really completed by the sour pickle. For an entree I had the seasonal lamb shoulder. Actually, I ordered a glass of Resurrection Cabernet Sauvignon. Back to the lamb shoulder. It came with a side of carrot puree and potatoes which were both seasoned to perfection. The main show of the night, the lamb shoulder, was exceptional. It was tender, it was juicy and tasted great. The meat is very savory but, completed by the sweet sauce on top. They cooked the shoulder very well and caramelized a little of the sauce in the process. For dessert, I order a great sweet wine, Victoria #2. Dessert in a glassThe wine pairings could not have been made without a great knowledgeable staff. Max's, I'll see you again soon!"}]
