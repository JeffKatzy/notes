Introduce some new concepts earlier 

May need in the engineering section to build up to idea of 
1. Features on one side -  List of lists 
2. Targets on the other side...one large list

This may seem weird, but it's almost like separating out the list of tasks having that all in one grid and the answers in another list.  


So then going 

1. targets, and features
   Justify separation of the two 
       That we may want to places our features in a list, and our targets in a separate list.
That steps are
A. Fit 
B. Parameters and Coef_
C. Once have those parameters, predict.

-> .fit(X_train, y_train)
Gradient descent may be ideal to talk about.
